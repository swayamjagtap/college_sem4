## Subject: Internet of Things (IoT)

### Course Description

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is rapidly transforming our world, creating a network of interconnected physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other items embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity. This course serves as a comprehensive introduction to the IoT ecosystem, from the fundamental building blocks to large-scale, real-world applications.

Students will explore how everyday objects can be turned into "smart" devices that collect and exchange data over the internet. We will cover the essential hardware, communication protocols, cloud platforms, and data analytics techniques that power IoT solutions, as well as the critical security and privacy challenges that must be addressed.
