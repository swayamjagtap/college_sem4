## Subject: Optimization Techniques

### Course Description

This course explores the theory and application of **Optimization Techniques**, a branch of applied mathematics focused on finding the **best possible solution** from a set of available alternatives, given a set of constraints.

In nearly every field—from engineering and finance to logistics and machine learning—we face problems that require maximizing a benefit (like profit or efficiency) or minimizing a cost (like time or resources). This subject provides the mathematical tools to formally model these problems and the algorithms to solve them. We will cover a range of methods, from classic linear programming to modern heuristic approaches.

### 📚 Key Topics Covered

* **Introduction to Optimization:**
    * Formulating optimization problems: objective functions, decision variables, and constraints.
    * Classifying optimization models (Linear vs. Non-linear, Constrained vs. Unconstrained).
* **Linear Programming (LP):**
    * **Graphical Method:** Visualizing and solving 2-variable LP problems.
    
    * **Simplex Algorithm:** A systematic method for solving multi-variable LP problems.
    * Duality and sensitivity analysis.
* **Network & Logistics Models:**
    * **Transportation Problem:** Minimizing the cost of shipping goods.
    * **Assignment Problem:** Optimally assigning tasks to agents.
    * Network flow models (e.g., shortest path, max flow).
* **Non-Linear Programming (NLP):**
    * Introduction to problems where the objective or constraints are non-linear.
    * **Convex Optimization:** Understanding why convex problems are "easier" to solve.
