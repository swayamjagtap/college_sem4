## Subject: Big Data Analysis

### Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the world of **Big Data**. As organizations generate unprecedented volumes of data, the ability to store, process, and extract meaningful insights has become a critical skill. This subject explores the fundamental challenges and opportunities of Big Data and equips students with the state-of-the-art tools and techniques used in the industry.

Students will move beyond traditional data processing to understand the **"3 V's" (Volume, Velocity, and Variety)** that define Big Data. We will explore distributed storage and processing frameworks, large-scale data analytics, and real-world applications.

### 📚 Key Topics Covered

* **Introduction to Big Data:**
    * Characteristics (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity)
    * Big Data challenges and opportunities
    * The Big Data ecosystem
* **Distributed Storage & Processing:**
    * **Hadoop:** Understanding the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and its architecture.
    * **MapReduce:** A programming model for processing large datasets in parallel.
* **Advanced Processing Frameworks:**
    * **Apache Spark:** In-depth exploration of Spark Core, Spark SQL, and Spark Streaming for faster, in-memory data processing.
* **NoSQL Databases:**
    * Understanding the limitations of traditional RDBMS.
    * Introduction to different NoSQL types (Key-Value, Document, Column-family, Graph).
* **Data Ingestion & Analytics:**
    * Tools for data ingestion (e.g., Flume, Kafka).
    * Techniques for analyzing and visualizing large datasets.
    * Introduction to data warehousing and business intelligence.
