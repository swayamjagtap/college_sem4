## Subject: Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, the discipline focused on creating intelligent agents and systems that can perceive their environment, reason, learn, and act autonomously.

We will explore the fundamental principles and techniques that form the basis of modern AI. The course covers the two major pillars: **symbolic AI** (based on logic and search) and **connectionist AI** (based on data and machine learning). Students will gain an understanding of how to build systems that can solve complex problems, make decisions under uncertainty, and learn from experience.

### 📚 Key Topics Covered

* **Introduction to AI:**
    * Definitions, history, and philosophical foundations of AI.
    * The concept of intelligent agents and environments.

* **Problem Solving & Search:**
    * **Uninformed Search:** Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).
    * **Informed (Heuristic) Search:** Greedy Best-First Search, A\* Search algorithm.
    
    * Game playing and adversarial search (Minimax algorithm).

* **Knowledge Representation & Reasoning:**
    * How to represent knowledge in a machine-readable way.
    * Propositional Logic and First-Order Logic.
    * Rule-based systems and expert systems.

* **Machine Learning (ML) Foundations:**
    * The core of modern AI; learning patterns from data.
    * **Supervised Learning:** Regression and Classification (e.g., Decision Trees, Naive Bayes).
    * **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering (e.g., k-Means) and dimensionality reduction.
