## Subject: Probability Distribution

### Course Description

This course is a foundational pillar of statistics and data science. It introduces students to the fundamental concepts of **probability** and **random variables**, which are the tools we use to model and quantify uncertainty in the real world.

We will move from basic probability theory to a systematic study of **probability distributions**. These distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes or events. The course covers the two major types of distributions—**Discrete** (for countable outcomes like "number of new users") and **Continuous** (for measurable outcomes like "temperature")—and explores the properties and applications of the most common ones.

### 📚 Key Topics Covered

* **Fundamentals of Probability:**
    * Sample spaces, events, and axioms of probability.
    * Conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem.
* **Random Variables:**
    * Defining Discrete and Continuous random variables.
    * **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** for discrete variables.
    * **Probability Density Function (PDF)** for continuous variables.
    * **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** for all variables.
* **Properties of Distributions:**
    * **Expected Value (Mean):** The long-run average of a variable.
    * **Variance & Standard Deviation:** Measures of spread or dispersion.
* **Common Discrete Distributions:**
    * **Bernoulli:** A single trial with two outcomes (e.g., coin flip).
    * **Binomial:** The number of successes in a fixed number of trials (e.g., 3 heads in 5 flips).
    * **Poisson:** The number of events in a fixed interval of time or space (e.g., customers arriving per hour).
* **Common Continuous Distributions:**
    * **Uniform:** All outcomes in a range are equally likely.
    * **Exponential:** The time between events (e.g., time until next customer arrives).
    * **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution:** The "bell curve," central to statistics due to the Central Limit Theorem.
* **Core Statistical Concepts:**
    * Understanding the **Central Limit Theorem** (CLT) and its importance.
    * Introduction to joint and marginal distributions.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

* **Differentiate** between discrete and continuous random variables and their respective probability functions (PMF/PDF).
* **Calculate** and **interpret** the expected value, variance, and standard deviation for a given distribution.
* **Identify** the correct probability distribution (e.g., Binomial, Poisson, Normal) to model a given real-world scenario.
* **Apply** the properties of these distributions to calculate the probabilities of specific outcomes.
* **Explain** the significance of the Normal Distribution and the Central Limit Theorem in statistics and data analysis.
