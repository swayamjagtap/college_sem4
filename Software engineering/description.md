## Subject: Software Engineering

### Course Description

This course introduces the foundational principles of **Software Engineering**, which is the application of a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.

Unlike programming, which focuses on writing code, software engineering covers the *entire lifecycle* of a software product. We will explore the structured processes, methodologies, and tools necessary to build high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software systems that meet user needs—especially for large-scale projects developed by teams.

### 📚 Key Topics Covered

* **Introduction to Software Engineering:**
    * Defining the discipline: programming vs. software engineering.
    * Ethics and professional practice.
* **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**
    * **Process Models:** Waterfall, Iterative, Spiral.
    * **Agile Methodologies:** Deep dive into Agile principles, Scrum, and Kanban.

* **Requirements Engineering:**
    * Eliciting, analyzing, and documenting user and system requirements.
    * Creating Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents.
* **Software Design:**
    * **Architectural Design:** High-level system structure (e.g., Client-Server, Microservices).
    * **Detailed Design:** Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles, UML diagrams (Class, Use Case, Sequence diagrams).
    * Design Patterns.
* **Software Construction:**
    * Coding standards, best practices, and code reviews.
    * Version control systems (e.g., Git).
* **Software Testing & Quality Assurance:**
    * Verification vs. Validation (V&V).
    * **Testing Levels:** Unit, Integration, System, and Acceptance testing.
    * Testing techniques (Black-box, White-box).
    * Software Quality Assurance (SQA) processes.
* **Software Project Management:**
    * Project planning and scheduling.
    * Cost and effort estimation (e.g., COCOMO model).
    * Risk management.
* **Software Maintenance:**
    * Types of maintenance (corrective, adaptive, perfective).
    * Legacy systems and re-engineering.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

* **Understand** and **compare** different SDLC models and choose the appropriate one for a project.
* **Elicit**, **analyze**, and **document** clear and testable software requirements.
* **Create** software design models using UML and apply fundamental design principles.
* **Apply** various testing strategies to find defects and ensure software quality.
* **Collaborate** effectively in a team environment, using version control and project management practices.
* **Appreciate** the challenges of building and maintaining large-scale software systems over their entire lifecycle.
